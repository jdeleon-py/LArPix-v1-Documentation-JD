This is a sequence of instuctions to install and successfully test the LArPix board.

First off, this is under the assumption that your machine has the capability to install and remove things with the 
pip command.

This first part can be installed without connecting to the physical board.

1. Open the terminal on your machine. 
      - If you are using MAC, use the MAC terminal.
      (From my experience, the native operating system a MAC uses matches up nicely with the larpix board.)
      
      - The next best operating system would be that of Ubuntu supported natively or via
        Virtual Machine, which can be downloaded onto your computer.
      
2. Make a directory to store all your larpix software and files
      - Use the command: 'mkdir larpix'
      
      * Side note:
          The command: 'ls' lets you observe all the contents in your current directory.
          The command: 'cd <directory_name>' lets you go into the directory file named 'directory-name'.
          The command: 'cd ..' moves back a layer in relation to which directory you are currently in.
        
      Use the command: 'cd larpix' to go into your larpix directory file.
      
3. Clone the larpix-control repositry from Github and install
      *Inside your larpix directory*
      
      - Use the command: 'git clone --branch release https://github.com/larpix/larpix-control'
        (This creates a repository, or sub-directory, in the larpix directory you just created.)
       
      - Go into the larpix-control repository.
        Use the command: 'cd larpix-control'
        (Check if your larpix-control repository is even there in the first place by using the command: 'ls')
